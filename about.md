> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

The intent of this blog is to provide advice on how to simplify your life.

Through simplification, we can live more meaningful, enjoyable lives.

By owning fewer things and consuming less, we leave more time and money for what truly matters:

* The people we care about

* The activities that excite us

* The impact we want to have on the world
