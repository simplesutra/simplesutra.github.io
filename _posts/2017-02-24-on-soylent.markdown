I love food.

I love preparing and eating meals with people. It's a natural bonding experience.

But I don't feel that every meal needs to be special.

Sometimes, I want a cheap, healthy, fast meal.

Sometimes I want a meal that doesn't distract me from my play/work.

That's why I value [Soylent](soylent).

From a foodie perspective, it's heretical.

But it's nutritionally sound. It's economical for my wallet and the environment.

It saves me time and money. It also makes me feel good.

It's a tool that can help you maximize your freedom.
